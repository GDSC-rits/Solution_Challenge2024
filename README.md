## General Information
- This application uses the Google Maps Platform API to display four types of markers (food, bathroom, dangerous, and shelter). When some kind of disaster occurs, users can flexibly share information with each other.
  
- The reason I created this application is because I saw how confused people were in the heavily damaged areas of Japan after the big earthquake on 1 January 2024. People affected by the disaster were confused because they did not know the correct information in the heavily damaged areas. I thought that by having local people post useful information to each other, confusion could be reduced.

## Technologies Used
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - version 3.0.2
- [google_maps_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter) - version 2.5.3


## Feature
- There are four buttons below.
  - Food - points to where food and water are distributed
  - Bathroom - points to where the toilet is located
  - Dangerous - points to places that are dangerous and should not be entered
  - Shelter - points to places of shelter

- By sharing these four elements among users, it can become an information network that can help people get to where they need to go, even
  in disaster areas.

## Room for Improvement
- I would like to add the ability for users to comment on each and every pin. For example, if there are comments such as "there is a lot of water at this food distribution point" or "there is a shortage of men's toilets," this would allow for more detailed information to be shared.

- Room for improvement:
  - Addition of comment function in each marker
  - Change to a more understandable user interface.
